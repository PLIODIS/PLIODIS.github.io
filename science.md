## Scientific Framework

The PLIODIS project integrates geomorphology, palaeoclimate and palaeovegetation reconstruction, hominin fossil functional morphology, and quantitative modeling to investigate hominin dispersal into southern Africa during the Plio–Pleistocene. Research is organized into three interconnected components, whilst various modeling approaches aim to combine the outcomes of the various strands of investigation within a coherent evolutionary framework.

## I. Geomorphology

### Drainage Pattern Evolution  
This sub-project reconstructs the evolution of drainage systems in the Kalahari and proto-Limpopo basin. Changes in river networks, basin connectivity, and topography are examined to identify potential dispersal corridors and barriers influencing hominin movement through time.

---

## II. Palaeoclimate and Palaeoenvironment  
Multiproxy palaeoclimatic data are used to reconstruct past precipitation regimes, vegetation structure, and environmental variability. These reconstructions provide the environmental context within which hominins dispersed, adapted, or became isolated.

## III. Morphology

### Mammalian Communities  
Hominin fossils are analysed to identify functional anatomical patterns related to locomotion, manipulation, and ecological adaptation. This approach helps assess whether southern African hominins occupied distinct adaptive niches.

### Functional adaptations of early hominins   
Biomechanical analyses investigate how skeletal morphology reflects functional performance. These studies evaluate locomotor efficiency, loading regimes, and potential behavioural differences among hominin populations.

## IV. Modelling approaches

### Quantitative Analyses  
Geometric morphometrics and statistical modeling quantify shape variation, disparity, and evolutionary change within and between hominin groups across regions and time periods.

### Testing dispersion scenarios

## III. Validation and Integration

### SP III.1. Evolutionary Rates  
Morphological and environmental datasets are integrated to estimate evolutionary rates and tempo. This allows testing of whether climatic and geomorphological shifts coincide with accelerated evolutionary change or stasis.

### SP III.2. Ecological Modeling  
Ecological and palaeobiogeographic models combine environmental reconstructions with fossil and morphological data to evaluate dispersal scenarios, gene flow, and population connectivity across Africa.

Together, these research components provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how environmental change, landscape evolution, and biological adaptation shaped early hominin dispersal into southern Africa.
