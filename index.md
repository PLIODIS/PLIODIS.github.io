    <h1>Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to southern Africa: <br> Choice or Chance?</h1>
  </div>
</div>


Modern humans migrated to colder regions out of Africa during the Pleistocene (Out-of-Africa), but evidence suggests that early hominins already inhabited temperate zones in South Africa millions of years earlier, i.e. during the Pliocene. The ERC-funded PLIODIS project explores the possible causes for this pan-African distribution of early hominins and how it may have shaped the course of our evolutionary history. To do so, we will reconstruct the geomorphological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin and the Zambezian region, explore the climatic and vegetation changes in deep time and examine the hominin fossil record against this ecological backdrop.                                                                                                                                                                                        
PLIODIS will tests several hypotheses: that early hominin ranges in East Africa expanded and contracted with changing wet and dry phases; that shifts in dispersal corridors led to intermittent gene flow between eastern African and southern African populations; and that tectonic changes eventually turned the Zambezi River into a significant barrier, leading to the endemism among South African hominins.

To untangle the interplay between geology, environment and hominin evolution, the project will:

1. [Determine geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin and Zambezian region]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#sp-i1-drainage-pattern-evolution)
2. [Create dynamic palaeo-precipitation and palaeo-vegetation models from multiple archives]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#sp-i2-palaeoclimate-and-palaeoenvironment)
3. [Carry out detailed anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#ii-morphology)
4. [Integrate these various datasets to evaluate species diversity (functional adaptations), gene flow (hybridization), and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography)]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#iii-validation-and-integration)
