## Understanding hominin dispersal to southern Africa in the Plio–Pleistocene

Modern humans migrated to colder regions out of Africa during the Pleistocene, but evidence suggests that early hominins inhabited temperate zones in South Africa millions of years ago. The ERC-funded **PLIODIS** project explores changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin and examines the hominin fossil record to better understand species diversity, gene flow, and dispersal patterns in deep time.

The project tests several hypotheses: that early hominin ranges in East Africa expanded and contracted with changing wet and dry phases; that shifts in dispersal corridors led to intermittent gene flow between East African and South African populations; and that tectonic changes eventually turned the Zambezi River into a significant barrier, prompting South African hominins to adapt to distinct ecological niches.

## Objective

Modern humans are unique in their ability to adapt to, and to thrive in, different environments. This trait facilitated their dispersal out-of-Africa to higher latitudes, i.e., to temperate and seasonal habitats, during the Pleistocene. However, there are Plio–Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa (SA) from ~3.7 Ma onwards.

Did human behavioural and physiological flexibility evolve early in our evolutionary history? Alternatively, did Pliocene hominins occupy such temperate zones due to different palaeoclimatic conditions in deep time and/or stochastic events?

To untangle these questions, this project will:

1. [Determine geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#sp-i1-drainage-pattern-evolution)
2. [Create dynamic palaeo-precipitation and palaeo-vegetation models from multiple archives]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#sp-i2-palaeoclimate-and-palaeoenvironment)
3. [Carry out detailed anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#ii-morphology)
4. [Integrate these datasets to evaluate species diversity (functional adaptations), gene flow (hybridization), and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography)]({{ site.baseurl }}/science/#iii-validation-and-integration)
